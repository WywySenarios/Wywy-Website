This is a framework for my personal website! Unforutnately, user friendliness is a secondary consideration when I am making this project.

To achieve basic functionality from this repository, the following packages NEED To be installed:
- node.js
- express.js
- cors (node js library)
- body-parser (node js library)
- sphp (node js library)

To achieve all functionality from this repository, the following packages should be installed:
- Python "google" package
- ua-parser-js (node js library) (this library will be deprecated soon??)
- fs (node js library)
- child_process (node js library)

NOTE: the batch file is automatically configured to run using a virtual environment. Change it if you need to use another installation of python.
